# Making sense of Unstructured Data

Nowadays, nearly everything in our lives can be quantified by data. Whether it involves search engine results, social media usage, weather trackers, cars, or sports, data is always being collected to enhance our quality of life. How do we get from all this raw data to improving the level of performance? The answer is found in this opening module! This module will introduce us to the tools and techniques developed to make sense of unstructured data and discover hidden patterns. Specifically, the main topics covered are:

1. **Supervised & Unsupervised Learning** and the main techniques corresponding to each one (Classification and Clustering, respectively)

2. An in-depth look at the **K-Means Clustering algorithm**

3. **Dimensionality Reduction & Spectral Techniques** (Clustering in networks, PCA, eigenvectors, embeddings, and other special clustering techniques)

## Goals

1. Understanding of the many different techniques used to discover patterns in a set of data

2. Knowledge of when to use each of the above techniques based on the given information

3. In-depth understanding of the K-Means algorithm

## Objectives

1. Know the difference between supervised learning and unsupervised learning

2. Know how to apply clustering and classification techniques

3. Understand how the K-Means algorithm works and how to implement one

4. Know what Mixed Membership Models and Feature Allocations are

5. Understand what Principal Component Analysis is and how to compute it using eigenvectors

6. Understand what Spectral and Modularity Clusterings are, as well as the term "embeddings"
